    <h2>What this app does</h2>
    <p>The App lets you upload or take photos/screenshots of financial charts. It uses an AI image-analysis service (Vision GPT API or equivalent) to analyze chart features and return a market-sentiment prediction and related insights.</p>

    <h2>Quick start — how to use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the App on your iOS device.</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Upload</strong> to select a chart image from your Photos, or tap <strong>Camera</strong> to take a new photo.</li>
      <li>Optionally crop or highlight the area of interest, then tap <strong>Analyze</strong>.</li>
      <li>Wait a few seconds while the image is processed — results will appear on screen with sentiment and a short explanation.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> For best results, upload clear screenshots or photos with visible price/time axes and minimal glare.
    </div>

    <h2>How image analysis works</h2>
    <p>When you submit an image, it is securely sent to our AI processing service which analyzes patterns, indicators, and price movement features to produce a sentiment estimate (e.g., bullish, bearish, neutral) and supplemental notes. The AI provides probabilistic insights — not guarantees.</p>

    <h2>Important — Not financial advice</h2>
    <p>The analysis is informational and educational only. It is <strong>not financial advice</strong>. Always verify with your own research and consult licensed financial professionals before making trading or investment decisions.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera & Photos:</strong> Required only if you choose to capture or upload images. You can revoke access in iOS Settings → Privacy → Camera / Photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required to send images to the AI service and receive results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy & data handling (summary)</h2>
    <p>We process only images you explicitly submit. We do not collect names, accounts, or other personal profile data. Images are processed for analysis and retained only as needed for that purpose or for short-term diagnostics. Read the full Privacy Policy in the Legal section for details.</p>

    <h2>Common questions</h2>
    <h3>Q: Can the app trade for me?</h3>
    <p>A: No. The App only provides analysis and insights. It does not execute trades or connect to brokerages.</p>

    <h3>Q: Will my screenshots be used to train the AI?</h3>
    <p>A: By default, submitted images are used only to produce the analysis you requested. We will not use your images for model training unless we obtain explicit, separate consent and clearly disclose that use.</p>

    <h3>Q: Why is the analysis sometimes incorrect?</h3>
    <p>A: AI predictions are probabilistic and depend on image quality, the type of chart, and market conditions. Always cross-check with additional indicators and professional advice.</p>

    <h3>Q: How long are images retained?</h3>
    <p>A: Images are retained only as long as needed to process the request and for short-term diagnostics/support. See the Privacy Policy for retention specifics.</p>
