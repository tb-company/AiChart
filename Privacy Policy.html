      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">AI Chart Trading Assistant — iOS version</p>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: October 19, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>AI Chart Trading Assistant</strong> (the “App”). Protecting your privacy and complying with Apple’s App Store policies and applicable privacy laws is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, when and why we share it, and your choices regarding that information for the iOS version of our App.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies only to information collected by the iOS App and related services provided by the developer. It does not cover third-party websites or services linked from the App.</p>

    <h2>2. What information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the minimum information necessary to provide the App’s core functionality — analyzing chart images to generate market-sentiment predictions — and to maintain, improve, and secure the App.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos & Camera (User Content)</strong>: When you take a picture or upload a chart image, that image is transmitted to our processing service (and/or third-party AI provider) solely to perform the requested analysis. We do not access your entire photo library; access occurs only with your explicit permission and only for the images you select or capture.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & Analytics</strong>: Non-identifying usage information such as features used, session length, and crash reports to help us improve the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Device information</strong>: Device model, iOS version, App version, and anonymous identifiers required for analytics and crash diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Support & Contact Data</strong>: If you contact support we may retain your email address and message content to respond and to troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Process images you submit to generate market-sentiment predictions and return results to you.</li>
      <li>Improve and secure the App (analytics, debugging, crash reporting).</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations if required.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Images you explicitly submit for analysis are processed to produce predictions. <strong>We do not use submitted images to train our models</strong> unless we obtain explicit prior consent which will be clearly disclosed.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Third-party services and processors</h2>
    <p>To deliver image analysis we use third-party AI/processing services (for example, Vision GPT API or other cloud AI providers). These providers receive only the data necessary to perform the processing and are contractually required to protect your data.</p>
    <p>When image data is transmitted to third parties it is encrypted in transit using industry standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS).</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain image data and other user-provided content only as long as required to process the request and to meet short-term diagnostic or support needs, after which such data is deleted or irreversibly anonymized. If we must retain any data for legal reasons we will do so only to the extent required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. App Tracking & Advertising identifiers (ATT / IDFA)</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to track you for advertising purposes. We do not engage in cross-app or cross-device tracking for advertising. If this changes in the future we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request permission through Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency framework before any tracking occurs.</li>
      <li>Update this policy and provide a clear in-App disclosure of the new behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Privacy controls & your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera & Photos permissions:</strong> You can grant or revoke access to the camera and photos via iOS Settings → Privacy → Camera / Photos. If you deny permission the App’s image-analysis feature will not function.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> If the App provides an opt-out for analytics within settings we will honor it. Otherwise, you may disable analytics collection by removing the App or changing permission settings where applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data / account requests:</strong> You may request deletion of any stored personal data (or account, if applicable) by contacting support at <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to verifiable requests in accordance with applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Examples include encrypted transmission (HTTPS) and limited access to production systems. No system is completely secure — in the unlikely event of a data incident we will follow applicable law and notify affected users and authorities as required.</p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or higher minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If a parent or guardian believes we have collected information from a child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a> and we will delete the information promptly.</p>

    <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be processed in servers located outside your country. When data is transferred cross-border we rely on contractual safeguards and applicable law to protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2>11. Legal bases for processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>For users in jurisdictions that require a legal basis for processing (for example the EU), we rely on the following bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For processing images you submit for analysis and when you explicitly grant permission to use camera/photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> For analytics, App security, and debugging (balanced against user rights and freedoms).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices or for legal, technical, or business reasons. When we change the policy we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact & data access requests</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, wish to exercise your privacy rights (access, correction, deletion), or need help disabling permissions, contact us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Support email:</strong> <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a></p>
