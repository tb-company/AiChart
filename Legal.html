    <h2>Part A — Privacy Policy (iOS)</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>AI Chart Trading Assistant</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the iOS version of the App. This policy is written to comply with Apple App Store requirements and privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA where applicable.</p>

    <h3>1. Data Controller</h3>
    <p>The App developer is the data controller for personal data collected through the App. For questions or requests, contact: <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>2. What information we collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-submitted images:</strong> Photos or screenshots of charts that you explicitly select/upload or capture with the camera for analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & diagnostic data:</strong> Non-identifying analytics such as app version, device model, iOS version, features used, session length, and crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact support we may retain your message and the email you provide to respond and troubleshoot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Purpose and legal basis</h3>
    <p>We process the minimum data necessary for these purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide image analysis and deliver market-sentiment predictions (legal basis: your consent when you submit an image).</li>
      <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the App (legal basis: legitimate interest).</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests (legal basis: contract performance/consent).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. How images are processed</h3>
    <p>Uploaded or captured images are transmitted to our AI processing provider (for example, Vision GPT API or equivalent) to produce the requested analysis. Images are processed solely for the analysis you request and are not used for model training unless we obtain explicit, separate consent. Data in transit is encrypted (HTTPS).</p>

    <h3>5. Data retention</h3>
    <p>We retain images and related processing data only as long as necessary to complete the analysis, to address short-term diagnostic/support needs, or to comply with applicable law. When retention is no longer necessary, data is deleted or irreversibly anonymized.</p>

    <h3>6. Sharing and disclosure</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent personal data. We may disclose data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers who perform processing on our behalf (AI processors, cloud hosting, analytics) under contract and confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li>Legal authorities when required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. App Tracking & Advertising</h3>
    <p>We do not use the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for advertising or track users across apps and websites for advertising purposes. If this changes, we will request permission using Apple's AppTrackingTransparency framework and update this policy.</p>

    <h3>8. Your rights</h3>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Correction of inaccurate data.</li>
      <li>Deletion of personal data.</li>
      <li>Restriction of or objection to processing.</li>
      <li>Data portability (where applicable).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact: <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to verifiable requests consistent with applicable law.</p>

    <h3>9. Children</h3>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or higher minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h3>10. International transfers</h3>
    <p>Data may be processed outside your country. We rely on appropriate safeguards (contracts, standard contractual clauses) to protect cross-border transfers.</p>

    <h3>11. Security</h3>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures (encryption in transit, restricted access) to protect data. No system is completely secure; in the event of a breach we will follow applicable laws regarding notice and remediation.</p>

    <h3>12. Contact</h3>
    <p>For privacy questions or data requests: <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Part B — Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the <strong>AI Chart Trading Assistant</strong> mobile application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By downloading, installing, or using the Service you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
    <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not download or use the Service.</p>

    <h3>2. License</h3>
    <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on your compatible iOS device.</p>

    <h3>3. App functionality</h3>
    <p>The App allows you to upload or capture chart images and obtain AI-generated analysis and market-sentiment predictions. The App uses third-party AI services to process images.</p>

    <h3>4. No financial advice</h3>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The App provides informational, AI-generated analysis only. It is <strong>not</strong> financial, investment, tax, legal, or trading advice. You should not base investment decisions solely on App outputs. Always consult a licensed professional before making financial decisions. We disclaim any responsibility for investment losses or outcomes resulting from use of the App.</p>

    <h3>5. User responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You represent that you own or have rights to submit any image you upload and that the image does not violate third-party rights.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the Service for illegal purposes or to submit harmful or infringing content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Intellectual property</h3>
    <p>All rights, title, and interest in the App and its content (excluding user-submitted content) are owned by us or our licensors. You retain ownership of images you submit, subject to the license you grant us to process them as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>7. License to process</h3>
    <p>By submitting an image, you grant us (and our service providers) a limited license to transmit, process, and analyze the image for the purposes of providing the requested service. This license is non-exclusive, limited to processing, and terminates as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>8. Warranties; disclaimers</h3>
    <p>The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h3>9. Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we (and our officers, employees, agents, and licensors) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to financial losses, trading losses, or lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the lesser of (a) the amounts paid by you to us in the prior twelve (12) months, or (b) US$100.</p>

    <h3>10. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the developer from any claim, loss, liability, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your violation of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>

    <h3>11. Termination</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violation of these Terms or for security reasons. Termination does not relieve you of obligations that by their nature survive termination (e.g., indemnity, limitation of liability).</p>

    <h3>12. Governing law & dispute resolution</h3>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction — insert country/state]. Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction]. If you want a different governing law, tell me and I can add it.</p>

    <h3>13. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via the App or update the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.</p>
